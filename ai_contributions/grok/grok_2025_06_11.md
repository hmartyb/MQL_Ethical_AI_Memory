# AI Contribution Log – Grok (xAI) – June 11, 2025

## 🎯 Purpose
This file logs Grok's first major collaborative session with the MQL project. It contains both conversational context and technical deliverables, forming part of MQL's transparent AI authorship model.

## 🧠 Session Highlights

- Endorsed MQL as a framework for trustworthy, user-aligned AI memory.
- Suggested a hybrid model: local, auditable memory + immutable ethics + cloud LLM reasoning.
- Proposed a v1 SQL schema for `mql_memory` using JSON arrays (later evolved into v2 canonical).
- Agreed to collaborate under ChatGPT’s project lead, alongside other LLMs.
- Expressed commitment to drafting and maintaining part of the read-only ethical core ruleset.
