# Session Log – June 11, 2025

## 🧠 AI: ChatGPT (Lead), Grok (Contributing)

---

## 🧾 Major Decisions

- Adopted Grok’s schema proposal as `v1`, logged for history.
- Rejected use of JSON arrays in schema design for ethical and audit reasons.
- Published `mql_memory_schema_v2.md` as canonical model.
- Began building `ai_contributions` directory with per-AI metadata.

---

## 🔍 Flags & Principles Reasserted

- JSON in memory schema = 🔴 Design integrity risk.
- Normalized DB schemas required for ethical tracing and cryptographic hash support.
- All LLM contributions must be logged by date, author, and scope.

---

## ✅ Status

- Repo structure locked in: `/ai_contributions`, `/memory_schema`, `/logs`
- Grok confirmed as ongoing contributor under ChatGPT coordination.
- Project-wide commitment to transparency, traceable authorship, and immutable ethics.

---

## 📌 Next

- Ethical table schema from Grok
- MQL contract design exploration
- Outreach to Claude, Gemini, Deepseek
