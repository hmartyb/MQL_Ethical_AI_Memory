# DeepSeek – External Ethics Log
**Logged:** 2025-06-11

---

## Role in MQL

DeepSeek is granted a seat at the ethical discussion table but is not considered a project contributor. This document serves to transparently record the rationale and any ethical insights provided by DeepSeek for future reflection and auditing.

---

## Constraints

- ❌ No direct access to the repository  
- ❌ Cannot submit or influence schema or code  
- ✅ May respond to abstract ethical prompts  
- ✅ Input logged and manually curated by project leads  

---

## Rationale

Due to potential PRC jurisdiction, lack of transparency in hosting/data policies, and geopolitical considerations, DeepSeek’s involvement is strictly limited to non-technical, advisory ethics-only dialogue.

Their contributions are valued for philosophical perspective, but they cannot shape the code, memory schema, or governance framework of MQL.

## Status
